## README

This is a class provided in University of Texas at Austin under mathematics department. My professor is Tran Ngoc at the time, and the class syllabus is attached above. There are totally six homework and a final project, where each homework will deal with one to three datasets.

I post what I did during the semester in each homework folders and the final project folder, and I edit each writeup to a md file with some feedback from my professor and also the hints in homework solutions.
