## README

This is a class provided in University of Texas at Austin under mathematics department. My professor was Ngoc Tran (https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/ntran/), and the class syllabus is attached above. There are totally six homework and a final project, where each homework will deal with one to three datasets.

I posted what I did during the semester in each homework folders and the final project folder. I edit each writeup to a md file with some feedback from my professor and also the hints in homework solutions.
