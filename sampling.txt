#--- research problem:
do garden programs increase veg. consumption in children?

#---- not well-defined yet: the population is not well-defined. 

Population:
children in school?
* which grade level? (high school? primary school?)
* where? (US? world wide?)

Narrow down:
Population:
* all primary school children in Texas (good. feasible.)
NOTE: this means all statements from our study will only apply to this population. 
#----------

#-----------NOW: sample or experiment?
An experiment means: two groups. In one group, you INTRODUCE a gardening program. Observe veg consumption over time. 

Sample means: find one (or a few) schools WITH a gardening program, one (or a few) schools WITHOUT a gardening program, and then compare veg. consumption. 

With experiment, because you have full control over the input variable of interest, you CAN make causality statements. 
(ie: BECAUSE of the school garden program, the veg. consumption change by XXX)

With sampling: it is an observational study. (ie: you cannot prove that difference in veg. consumption between two groups is due to the school garden program alone). Can only shows CORRELATION. 

ie: conclusion could be something like:
"schools with veg. program are observed to have higher veg. consumption rate by X amount".
(can still quantify the difference, but you canNOT attribute the difference to the veg. program alone).

Let's do an experiment. 
High level idea:
* take a "typical school"
* record veg. consumption ***NON-TRIVIAL*** 
====
* implement a veg program. Wait for X months. 
* record veg. consumption again. 

Possible issues:
1/ HOW reliably record veg consumption?
* duration: need to average over a long term (eg: a month) to avoid daily flunctuations. 
 (idea: we expect if there were a diff. due to the school veg. program, this diff. could be smaller than daily flunctuations). ie: should record over a long period of time. 
* eg: a month. 
* parents + school cafeteria: record veg. bought, estimate veg. consumption. 
* some issues with this: 
+ this is just an estimation of veg. consumption. 
+ biases: veg goes in trash, eat out elsewhere, parents forgot to record, etc etc
(can discuss this for long time). 





2/ seasonal effects (veg consumption can differ between summer vs winter).
Suggestions: 
+ implement the program in spring (install in January, end in May). Ok but this does not eliminate the seasonal effects
+ record annual consumption?

3/ how to choose a "typical" primary school in Texas?
* take a directory of public + private schools
* use random number generator to pick one uniformly at random. 
* GOOD. 























 

 



#-- for most likely impact: should look for a favorable population. 
#NOT the same as actively choosing a sample. 
#sample should always be a representative sample of your population
#the population is what your research will be about. 




























#--- on homework 4: on the interaction term. 
#--- two categorical variables: relation (girlfriend or acquaintance), weight (obese or not)
#--- the interaction term between these two variables is 
relation:weight 
relation.weight (read: "relation times weight")
consists of 4 categories (all possible combinations between relation and weight):
0,1,2,3. 
0 = girlfriend, obese
1 = girlfriend, normal
2 = acq., obese
3 = acq. normal. 
#--- run lm with interaction term in R:
model <- lm(qualified ~ relation+weight+relation:weight, data = data). 
#---- (MORE DISCUSSIONS: on Thursday. (Will do an explicit example in class)).
